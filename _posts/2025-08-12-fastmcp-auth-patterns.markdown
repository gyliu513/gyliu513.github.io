FastMCP offers three complementary ways to protect your MCP servers over HTTP/SSE, ranging from simple token checks to a full OAuth 2.0 stack. This guide summarizes each pattern, when to use it, and how to get started—complete with architecture diagrams you can share with your team.

Reference: see the FastMCP Authentication docs: [Authentication — FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/authentication).

## Pattern 1: Token Validation (JWT Verifier)

Validate structured tokens (typically JWTs) that were issued elsewhere. Your FastMCP server acts as a resource server: it trusts tokens signed by a known issuer and focuses on authorization based on claims.

- When it fits: you already have an IdP/API gateway issuing JWTs; microservices need consistent validation; lowest implementation complexity.
- What you manage: verification config (issuer, audience, JWKS URI) and authorization logic.
- What you delegate: user authentication and token issuance.

### Architecture
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Client] -->|Bearer token| B[FastMCP Server]
    B --> C[JWT Verifier]
    C -->|fetch keys| D[Issuer JWKS]
    C -->|verify signature+exp+aud+iss| E{Valid?}
    E -- yes --> F[Authorize & Serve]
    E -- no --> G[401/403]
```

### Diagram walkthrough
- Client sends a request with a Bearer access token.
- FastMCP passes the token to the JWT verifier component.
- Verifier fetches public keys from the issuer's JWKS (and caches them).
- Verifier checks signature, expiration/nbf, issuer, and audience claims.
- If valid, the server enforces authorization (scopes/claims) and serves; otherwise it returns 401/403.

### Minimal setup
```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

auth = JWTVerifier(
    jwks_uri="https://your-auth-system.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="https://your-auth-system.com",
    audience="your-mcp-server",
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Protected Server", auth=auth)
```

Environment-based configuration also works well for deployments:
```bash
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=JWT
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_JWKS_URI="https://auth.example.com/jwks"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_ISSUER="https://auth.example.com"
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE="mcp-server"
```

## Pattern 2: Remote OAuth (External Identity Provider)

Advertise OAuth metadata so MCP clients can automatically discover how to obtain tokens from a trusted external provider (e.g., WorkOS, Auth0, Azure AD). FastMCP validates tokens while the IdP handles login, MFA, recovery, and security hardening.

- When it fits: production apps needing enterprise-grade auth without building it yourself; consistent SSO; dynamic client registration.
- What you manage: which IdPs you trust and your authorization rules.
- What you delegate: all user authentication flows and token lifecycle.

#### Architecture
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Client] -->|Discover OAuth metadata| B[FastMCP Server]
    B --> C[OAuth Discovery Endpoints]
    A -->|Obtain token| D[External IdP]
    D -->|JWT/OIDC token| A
    A -->|Bearer token| B
    B --> E[Token Verifier]
    E -->|validate| F{Valid?}
    F -- yes --> G[Authorize & Serve]
    F -- no --> H[401/403]
```

### Diagram walkthrough
- Client discovers the server's OAuth metadata endpoints exposed by FastMCP.
- Using that metadata, the client obtains a token from the external IdP (e.g., device flow, client credentials).
- The IdP issues an OIDC/JWT access token to the client.
- Client calls the FastMCP server with the Bearer token.
- FastMCP validates the token using the verifier (via the IdP's JWKS) and authorizes on success; otherwise 401/403.

### Minimal setup (example: WorkOS AuthKit)
```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.workos import AuthKitProvider

auth = AuthKitProvider(
    authkit_domain="https://your-project.authkit.app",
    base_url="https://your-fastmcp-server.com",
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Enterprise Server", auth=auth)
```

## Pattern 3: Full OAuth (Built-in Authorization Server)

Run the entire OAuth 2.0 authorization server inside FastMCP. You implement credential verification, consent, token issuance/refresh, client registration, and storage.

- When it fits: air-gapped or highly specialized environments; strict compliance; bespoke flows you must own end-to-end.
- Trade-off: maximum control with maximum complexity and ongoing security responsibilities.

#### Architecture
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph FastMCP Server
        B[Resource Endpoints]
        C[Authorization Endpoint]
        D[Token Endpoint]
        E[Client Registry]
        F[User Store]
    end

    A[Client] -->|Authorize| C
    C -->|Consent/AuthN| F
    C -->|Code| A
    A -->|Code| D
    D -->|Access/Refresh Tokens| A
    A -->|Bearer token| B
    B -->|Authorize & Serve| A
```

### Diagram walkthrough
- Client initiates authorization at the Authorization Endpoint.
- FastMCP authenticates the user and handles consent using the configured user store/policies.
- Authorization Endpoint returns an authorization code to the client.
- Client exchanges the code at the Token Endpoint for access (and optionally refresh) tokens.
- Client calls protected resource endpoints with the access token; server validates and authorizes based on scopes/claims.
- Client registry maintains client IDs/secrets and allowed grant types.

### Minimal structure
```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.oauth import MyOAuthProvider

auth = MyOAuthProvider(
    user_store=your_user_database,
    client_store=your_client_registry,
    # additional configuration...
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="Auth Server", auth=auth)
```

## Choosing Your Path (Quick Guide)

| Pattern | Control | Complexity | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Token Validation | Low | Low | Teams with existing JWT/SSO issuing tokens |
| Remote OAuth | Medium | Medium | Production apps needing enterprise IdP integration |
| Full OAuth | High | High | Specialized/air-gapped environments with strict requirements |

Tips:
- Start simple with Token Validation if your platform already issues JWTs.
- Prefer Remote OAuth for most production use-cases; it balances features and effort.
- Choose Full OAuth only when you have clear, compelling reasons and the expertise to own it securely.
