> **TL;DR**: `AGENTS.md` is a simple, open Markdown file you add to your repo to give AI coding agents the exact build, test, and contribution instructions they need—without cluttering your human-facing README.

---

## Background

AI coding agents (and AI-powered IDEs) increasingly participate in routine engineering tasks: setting up dev environments, running tests, applying code style rules, and preparing pull requests. Unlike humans, agents benefit from a **predictable, machine-readable place** to discover these instructions. Traditional `README.md` files are optimized for people; they’re concise, marketing-friendly, and often omit the gritty details agents need (exact commands, monorepo conventions, CI nuances, etc.).

`AGENTS.md` addresses this gap with a **convention over configuration** approach: put agent-facing guidance in one well-known file that tools can read consistently.

---

## What is AGENTS.md?

`AGENTS.md` is a **simple, open format** (just Markdown) placed at the root of your repository—and optionally inside subpackages of a monorepo—to give coding agents clear instructions about your project. There is **no required schema**; you write normal Markdown and include what agents should do and how they should do it (build, test, lint, run, style, PR rules, security caveats, data constraints, etc.).

Popular sections include:
- Project overview and architecture notes
- **Setup & build commands** (install, dev server, build artifacts)
- **Test commands & CI expectations**
- **Code style** (language level, linting rules, formatting)
- **PR & commit conventions**
- **Security and dependency policies**

Because it is just Markdown, it works across editors, CLIs, and agents.

---

## Why do we need it?

- **Predictability for agents**: Agents know exactly where to look for operational details, reducing hallucinations, guesswork, and repeated trial/error.
- **Keeps READMEs human-focused**: Your `README.md` stays concise for humans while `AGENTS.md` carries operational depth for machines.
- **Cross-tool compatibility**: A single file that many agents can ingest (IDEs, CLIs, agent frameworks), avoiding proprietary configs.
- **Scales to monorepos**: Place `AGENTS.md` near each package to provide local rules that override the repo root.
- **Executable guidance**: When you include commands (tests, linters), capable agents can execute them and iterate until the checks pass.

## Architecture (Conceptual)

    subgraph Pkg1["packages/app"]

    subgraph Pkg2["packages/lib"]
      A3[AGENTS.md<br/>Lib-specific rules]
    end
  end

  Agent -->|Nearest-file wins| A3
  Agent -->|Human context| R1

  A1 -->|Commands & policies| Tools
  A2 -->|Commands & policies| Tools
  A3 -->|Commands & policies| Tools
```

**Notes**

- Agents read **the nearest `AGENTS.md`** relative to the file(s) they’re editing in a monorepo (local overrides root).
- Tools (linters, test runners, build tools) are **invoked per instructions** documented in the file.

## Workflow (End-to-end)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Dev as Developer
  participant Agent as Coding Agent / IDE / CLI
  participant Repo as Repo (README.md, AGENTS.md, packages/*)
  participant Tools as Tooling (lint, test, build, CI)

  Dev->>Agent: "Implement feature X"
  Agent->>Repo: Locate nearest AGENTS.md
  Repo-->>Agent: Return Markdown instructions (setup, style, tests, PR rules)
  Agent->>Tools: Run setup/build/test commands from AGENTS.md
  Tools-->>Agent: Results (failures, logs)
  Agent->>Repo: Apply fixes per style/test guidance
  Agent->>Dev: Propose patch & PR description compliant with AGENTS.md
```

**Highlights**

- If `AGENTS.md` provides commands (e.g., `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`), capable agents **execute them before finishing the task**.
- Human prompts still **override** file guidance, but `AGENTS.md` dramatically shortens _prompting_ by codifying routine rules.

## A Simple Example (with explanation)

Below is a minimal-yet-useful `AGENTS.md` you can drop into a TypeScript monorepo. It encodes the **dev setup**, **test plan**, **style rules**, and **PR checklist** that agents should follow. Adjust to your stack (e.g., Python/Poetry, Java/Maven, Go, Rust).

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Setup
- Install deps: `pnpm install`
- Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
- Build: `pnpm build`

## Code style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Single quotes, no semicolons
- Prefer functional patterns

## Testing
- Unit tests: `pnpm test`
- Monorepo: `pnpm turbo run test --filter <package>`
- Lint: `pnpm lint --filter <package>`
- CI plan lives in `.github/workflows/*`

## PR rules
- Title format: `[<package>] <Title>`
- Before commit: run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test`
- Add/refresh tests for changed code

## Security
- Do not commit secrets; use `.env.example`
- Review dependency changes before release
```

**Why this works**

- Agents get **exact commands** (less guessing).
- Style gates are explicit, so agents **format and refactor appropriately**.
- PR policy is encoded, so the agent can **draft compliant PR titles/descriptions**.
- In a monorepo, you can add a **package-local `AGENTS.md`** whose instructions override the root for better context locality.

---

## Key Takeaways

- `AGENTS.md` is **just Markdown**—no learning curve or vendor lock-in.
- It **complements** your `README.md`: humans there, **machines here**.
- It reduces **prompt boilerplate** and **agent guesswork**, improving reliability.
- It scales to **monorepos**; the **closest file wins**.
- When you list commands, capable agents can **run them and iterate** automatically.
- Treat it as **living documentation** and update as workflows evolve.
