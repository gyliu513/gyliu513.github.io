## Introduction
As AI systems evolve, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** has emerged as a standard for connecting models with external tools and data. At the heart of this ecosystem, Anthropic introduced **MCPB (MCP Bundle)** — a packaging format designed to simplify how MCP servers are distributed, installed, and executed.  

Think of MCPB as the **“app bundle” for MCP servers**: it encapsulates everything you need to run an MCP server in a single portable file. This blog explores what MCPB is today, how it works, and where it could go in the future.

---

## What is MCPB?
MCPB stands for **MCP Bundle**, a single-file distribution format for MCP servers. It packages:
- **Server code** (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- **`manifest.json`** (server metadata: tools, resources, config)
- **Dependencies** (optional runtime libraries)
- **Assets** (icons, screenshots, docs)

This format solves a key pain point: without MCPB, installing an MCP server can be messy (different dependencies, languages, and configs). With MCPB, you just need the `.mcpb` file — making distribution and installation frictionless.

---

## How MCPB Works

1. **Developer prepares source code**
   - Includes `manifest.json`, dependencies, and optional assets.  

2. **Pack into `.mcpb` file**
   ```bash
   npx -y @anthropic-ai/mcpb pack . my-server.mcpb
   ```

3. **Distribute**
   - Share via GitHub Release, internal repo, or a future MCP marketplace.

4. **Load into host**
   - Claude Desktop, IDE plugins to load the `.mcpb` file directly.  

5. **Run the server**
   - The host spins up the MCP server, exposing its tools and resources.

## Example `manifest.json`
Here’s a simplified snippet you might see inside a bundle:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": "0.2",
  "name": "my-mcp",
  "display_name": "My MCP Server",
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "description": "My MCP Server",
  "author": {
    "name": "me",
    "email": "me@example.com"
  },
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "hello_world",
      "description": "Hello World"
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "hello",
      "type": "world"
    }
  ],
  "user_config": {
    "version": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Version",
      "description": "Version of the package which is being installed.",
      "default": "0.3.0",
      "required": false
    }
  },
  "license": "Apache 2.0",
}
```

This manifest defines what the server offers (tools, resources) and how users configure it. Check [mcpb examples](https://github.com/anthropics/mcpb/tree/main/examples) to see more details.

## Why MCPB Matters
- **Portability**: One file contains everything.  
- **Ease of installation**: No dependency hell.  
- **Standardization**: Hosts know exactly how to load a `.mcpb`.  
- **Ecosystem growth**: Easier for developers to publish, easier for users to consume.  

---

## Long-Term Vision
If MCP is the **operating system for AI-native applications**, then MCPB is the **application bundle format**.  
Just as we rely on `.jar` files in Java, `.deb` packages in Linux, and `.vsix` files for VSCode, MCPB has the potential to become the **standard way to distribute AI plugins and agents**.  

It’s not just a packaging format — it’s the foundation for a thriving AI-native app ecosystem.  

---

## Conclusion
MCPB is still young, but it already shows promise as the **distribution backbone of the MCP ecosystem**. By solving installation pain points and paving the way for registries, marketplaces, and AI-driven tooling, MCPB could become the **“Docker image” or “npm package” of AI-native development**.  

For developers: start experimenting with `@anthropic-ai/mcpb`.  
For ecosystem builders: imagine what a world of MCPB-powered apps could look like.  
The future of AI observability, orchestration, and interaction may very well be packaged inside a `.mcpb`.
