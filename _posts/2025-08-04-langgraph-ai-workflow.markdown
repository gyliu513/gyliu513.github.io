# Design Smarter AI Workflows with LangGraph: State, Messages, Context, and Control Flow Demystified

LangGraph isn't just another workflow engine—it's a flexible, stateful, and intelligent system for managing complex AI flows. Whether you're building a chatbot, a multi-agent orchestration system, or a retrieval-augmented generator (RAG), LangGraph gives you tools to:

- Maintain evolving state
- Control the flow of execution
- Track full message history
- Inject runtime dependencies
- Speed up performance with caching

In this blog, we explore **State**, `add_messages`, `Send`, `Command`, and `Runtime Context` through clear examples and visual diagrams.

## 🔢 Understanding State: The Core of LangGraph

In LangGraph, **State** is a shared, typed dictionary that flows through your graph. Nodes read from and write to this `state`, which evolves over time.

### ✅ Use Case: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Workflow

#### 📄 State Definition
```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage
from typing import Annotated

class RAGState(TypedDict):
    query: str
    retrieved_docs: list[str]
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    response: str
```
This code defines a state schema named `RAGState` for a RAG pipeline. It tracks the user query, retrieved documents, full message history (merged automatically), and the final response.

#### 🌐 Workflow Overview
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Input] --> B[Vector Search]
    B --> C[Generate Response]
    C --> D[Return Response]
```

Each node adds fields to the state or appends to `messages`.

#### 📊 Node: User Input
```python
def get_query(state: RAGState):
    return {
        "query": "What is LangGraph?",
        "messages": [HumanMessage(content="What is LangGraph?")]
    }
```
This node captures the user's query and appends it to the `messages` list.

#### 📊 Node: Vector Search
```python
def retrieve_docs(state: RAGState):
    docs = vector_search(state["query"])
    return {"retrieved_docs": docs}
```
This node performs a vector search based on the query and stores the results in `retrieved_docs`.

#### 📊 Node: Generate Response
```python
def generate_response(state: RAGState):
    context = "
".join(state["retrieved_docs"])
    answer = call_llm(f"{context}

Answer: {state['query']}")
    return {
        "response": answer,
        "messages": [AIMessage(content=answer)]
    }
```
This node takes the retrieved documents, sends them to an LLM for response generation, saves the output to `response`, and appends the AI's reply to `messages`.

---

## 📈 Working with `add_messages`: Track Chat History Seamlessly

By annotating a field with `add_messages`, LangGraph automatically merges messages from multiple nodes. No manual merging required.

### ✅ ChatState Example
```python
class ChatState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
```
This defines a minimal state where the only tracked field is `messages`. Thanks to `add_messages`, all messages from different nodes will be appended.

### ✅ Message-Adding Nodes
```python
def user_input(state: ChatState):
    return {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Tell me a joke about cats")]} 

def agent_response(state: ChatState):
    return {"messages": [AIMessage(content="Why was the cat on the computer? It wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!")]}
```
These nodes simulate a simple interaction between a user and an AI agent, each appending a message to the shared chat history.

### 🌐 Message Flow:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Input] --> B[Agent Response]
```

### 📖 Final messages
```json
[
  {"type": "human", "content": "Tell me a joke about cats"},
  {"type": "ai", "content": "Why was the cat on the computer? It wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!"}
]
```
LangGraph auto-merges messages without needing manual list handling.

## 🌐 Dynamic Fan-out with `Send`

When you want to dynamically split your state into multiple downstream paths (e.g., MapReduce), use `Send`.

### 📋 Use Case: Generate a joke for each subject
```python
from langgraph.graph import Send

def continue_to_jokes(state):
    return [Send("generate_joke", {"subject": s}) for s in state["subjects"]]
```
This function generates one `Send` for each subject in `state["subjects"]`, effectively creating multiple parallel paths to `generate_joke`.

### 📊 Conditional Edges
```python
graph.add_conditional_edges("get_subjects", continue_to_jokes)
```
This adds conditional logic to the graph so that the outputs of `get_subjects` fan out to multiple invocations of `generate_joke`.

### ▶️ Visual
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Split Subjects] -->|dogs| B[generate_joke]
    A -->|cats| B
```
Each subject gets its own execution path.

---

## 🔄 Combining State and Routing with `Command`

Instead of using conditional edges + state updates separately, you can return a `Command` object.

### ✅ Example
```python
from langgraph.graph import Command

def judge(state):
    if state["x"] > 0:
        return Command(update={"result": "positive"}, goto="handle_positive")
    else:
        return Command(update={"result": "negative"}, goto="handle_negative")
```
This node updates the state and chooses the next node (`handle_positive` or `handle_negative`) based on the value of `x`.

### 🌐 Visual
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Judge] -->|x > 0| B[handle_positive]
    A -->|else| C[handle_negative]
```

---

## 🏠 Injecting Runtime Dependencies with `ContextSchema`

Use `context_schema` to inject non-state config (like LLM provider, DB connection) at runtime.

### ✅ Step 1: Define context
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ContextSchema:
    llm_provider: str
```
This defines a runtime-only configuration schema with an LLM provider string.

### ✅ Step 2: Use in graph
```python
graph = StateGraph(State, context_schema=ContextSchema)
```
Register the context schema with the graph.

### ✅ Step 3: Access inside a node
```python
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime

def node_a(state, runtime: Runtime[ContextSchema]):
    llm = get_llm(runtime.context.llm_provider)
    return {"response": llm.generate(...)}
```
This node accesses the injected LLM provider from the runtime context.

---

## ⚡️ Speeding Things Up with Node Caching

Use `CachePolicy` to skip re-executing expensive nodes if input hasn't changed.

### ✅ Example
```python
from langgraph.cache.memory import InMemoryCache
from langgraph.types import CachePolicy

def expensive_node(state):
    time.sleep(2)
    return {"result": state["x"] * 2}

builder.add_node("expensive_node", expensive_node, cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl=5))
graph = builder.compile(cache=InMemoryCache())
```
This example defines a slow node (simulated with `time.sleep`) and attaches a caching policy with a TTL of 5 seconds.
